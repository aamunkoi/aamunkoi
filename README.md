## ðŸŒŸ Projects

Here are some of the projects I'm proud of:

- [Passel Discord Bot](https://github.com/aamunkoi/passel_public): Passel is a discord bot that manages the number of pins in a server. Discord has a pin limit of 50 pins per channel. However, with passel, that limit can be bypassed. 
- [MeHe](https://github.com/CSC510-G35-Fall2022/Mental_Health): Aspects of social media have become detrimental to mental health, and since many people spend hours a day on Discord, this bot is here to help users improve their mental health as they use Discord. Below is a list of working functionalities as well as install and contributing instructions. 
- [Decoding Phonecase Reviews using Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/aamunkoi/CSC_522_FP/blob/main/ALDA_Final_Project_Group_23.pdf): When buying a product online, reviews offer consumers a justification on whether or not they want to buy the product. Stars are a succinct way of telling the consumer how otherâ€™s think of the product, but not all websites use a star system. Therefore, using a classification model to predict the star rating of a review can offer assistance to consumers that need a quick way of judging the sentiment around a product. For our models, we decided to focus specifically on phone case ratings because of the ease of access to a large number of data.
- [Sway & XPLN modifications](https://github.com/nakraft/exploreASE/blob/main/docs/exploreASE.pdf): Additional modifications to these algorithms can support the overall development of state-of-the-art clustering techniques to address stakeholdersâ€™ prioritization of features. Multi-objective semi-supervised learning models will provide value across domains and should continue to be researched thoroughly to support interdisciplinary domains.
